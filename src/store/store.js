    description: "<p>The Alternate-leaved Dogwood (Cornus alternifolia), also known as Pagoda Dogwood for its tiered, horizontal branches, is a deciduous tree that boasts a unique architectural flair in woodland gardens. This North American native typically matures to a modest 15-25 feet tall, flourishing in the understory with a preference for partial shade and well-drained, acidic soils. Its leaves, arranged alternately as its name suggests—uncommon among dogwoods—emerge as a bright green, turning to purplish-red in the fall. In late spring to early summer, the tree is adorned with clusters of small, creamy-white flowers, which give way to dark blue berries on red stems, providing a feast for native birds. The tree's bark, mottled and gray, adds winter interest. With a low canopy and non-invasive root system, the Alternate-leaved Dogwood is a versatile addition to residential landscapes, offering year-round visual appeal and ecological benefits.</p>"

It has a broadly columnar to rounded shape, with a straight trunk and symmetrically branching crown. Heart-shaped, serrated leaves flutter in the slightest breeze and turn a vibrant yellow come autumn. In early summer, small, fragrant cream-colored flowers dangle from slender peduncles, drawing in a symphony of pollinators; these blooms later develop into small, nut-like fruits. The Basswood's soft, lightweight wood is highly valued for carving and woodworking. A gentle giant in the landscape, the American Basswood is a favorite for wildlife and a classical choice for shade in urban and rural settings.</p>",

Its most distinctive feature is the inflated, bladder-like seed pods that hang in clusters, turning from green to a papery brown as they mature in the fall. These whimsical pods add a unique textural element to the landscape and a point of interest in winter after the leaves have fallen. The tree's foliage is comprised of trifoliate leaves, which are arranged oppositely on arching branches, presenting a soft green hue in spring and transforming to a clear yellow in autumn. In spring, drooping clusters of fragrant, bell-shaped white flowers grace the tree, providing a delicate floral display. The American Bladdernut is a versatile and low-maintenance choice for naturalized areas or woodland gardens.</p>",

Recognized by its broad, spreading canopy, the tree was both a timber staple and a critical wildlife food source, with its abundant, nutritious nuts. Its leaves are long and narrow with a toothed edge, and they turn to a golden hue in autumn. However, the early 20th century saw this species decimated by the chestnut blight, a fungal disease accidentally introduced from imported Asiatic chestnut trees. The blight's devastation transformed this once-dominant tree into a rarity, leaving behind only the sprouting stumps of former giants, as the blight does not affect the roots which can still resprout. Efforts are ongoing to restore this species through science and selective breeding with blight-resistant trees. The American Chestnut's tale is a poignant reminder of the fragility and interconnectedness of ecological systems.</p>",

In the spring, small, inconspicuous flowers appear before the leaves, developing into flat, papery samaras, or winged seeds. However, the mid-20th century saw this majestic tree besieged by Dutch elm disease, a fungal infection spread by bark beetles, leading to widespread decimation of the population. Despite this, the American Elm remains a symbol of strength and endurance, with ongoing efforts to cultivate disease-resistant varieties. Its wood, once used for shipbuilding and furniture, is now less commonly harvested due to its rarity. The American Elm's story is one of both ecological loss and the hope for restoration.</p>",

Typically reaching 15 to 30 feet in height, it graces the landscape with a rounded crown and fine, textured foliage. Its compound leaves are composed of numerous leaflets, turning a striking array of oranges and reds in the autumn. In late spring to early summer, the tree is adorned with dense clusters of white flowers, which develop into vibrant, orange-red berries by late summer. These berry clusters persist into winter, offering a valuable food source for birds and wildlife. The Mountain-ash is not a true ash but is so named for its ash-like leaves. Its slender gray bark and modest stature make it an excellent choice for residential gardens where its ornamental berries and fall color can be a focal point.",

The foliage turns a modest yellow in the fall. Known for its extremely hard and rot-resistant wood, Black Locust is valued for use in outdoor construction and furniture. Despite its beauty and utility, it is often considered invasive outside its native range due to its prolific seeding and rapid growth.</p>",

    description: "<p>The Blue Beech, also known as the American Hornbeam or Carpinus caroliniana, is a small, shade-tolerant deciduous tree native to the understory of eastern North American forests. It grows modestly to 20-30 feet high, featuring a short trunk and a rounded, spreading crown. The tree's bark is smooth, gray, and fluted, resembling the sinewy muscles of a human arm, which earns it another nickname, \"musclewood.\"</p><p>Its leaves are elliptical, with finely toothed edges and prominent veins, offering a vibrant green that transitions to a fiery mix of orange, red, and yellow in the fall. In spring, the Blue Beech displays modest yellow-green catkins, later developing small nutlets encased in papery bracts that provide food for wildlife.</p><p>Appreciated for its hard wood and ornamental appeal, the Blue Beech is often found along streams and rich bottomlands, thriving in moist, well-drained soils. Its tolerance for shade and unique bark texture make it a favorite for naturalistic landscaping and garden settings.</p>",

It has a broad crown and a high branching habit with several main limbs that create a somewhat irregular, rounded shape. Its bark is light gray-brown, deeply cleft into broad ridges, giving it a rough texture.</p><p>What sets the Boxelder apart from other maples is its compound leaves, which are unusual for the genus, consisting of 3-7 leaflets with a coarsely toothed margin. These leaves turn a pale yellow in the fall. It's a dioecious species, with male and female flowers appearing on separate trees in early spring, before the leaves emerge.</p><p>The Boxelder is often found along streams and in floodplains, thriving in a variety of soil conditions. While its wood is of little commercial value, the tree is known for its resilience and is sometimes planted as a fast-growing screen or shade tree. It's also known for attracting boxelder bugs, especially in the autumn and winter.</p>",

These leaves turn shades of yellow and russet in the fall.</p><p>In spring, the Chestnut Oak produces inconspicuous yellow-green flowers, which give way to sizable, round acorns, a valuable food source for wildlife. The wood of the Chestnut Oak is strong and heavy, making it valuable for timber and veneer production. As a landscape tree, it offers stately beauty and a resilient character, providing robust shade and a steadfast presence.</p>",

While the fruit is tart and astringent when raw, it becomes palatable when cooked and is often used in jellies and wines.</p><p>The tree's bark is gray to reddish-brown, marked by horizontal lenticels. Though not a first choice for lumber due to its small size, Chokecherry is valued in landscaping for its attractive spring blossoms and its ability to attract birds and butterflies to the garden. However, care should be taken as the seeds, leaves, and twigs contain compounds that are toxic to many mammals, including humans, when not properly processed.</p>",

This stately tree exhibits a straight trunk and a pyramidal to rounded crown as it matures, exuding an aura of elegance and strength.</p><p>Its leaves are sizeable and oblong, with a lush green hue, turning to a golden-yellow in the fall, adding a splash of color to the autumnal landscape. The tree derives its common name from its unique, cucumber-shaped green fruits, which mature to a deep red as they ripen, revealing bright red seeds that are favored by wildlife.</p><p>Spring brings forth the Cucumber Tree’s flowers, which are less showy than those of its magnolia relatives but hold a subtle beauty; they are yellow-green, tulip-shaped, and emerge high in the tree. With its tall stature and low-maintenance character, the Cucumber Tree is a majestic addition to large spaces, parks, and rural landscapes, offering a serene and shady retreat.</p>",

It typically attains heights of 50 to 70 feet, characterized by a straight, slender trunk and a rounded, open canopy. The tree's bark is smooth and pale when young, becoming darker and deeply furrowed with age.</p><p>As suggested by its name, the Large-tooth Aspen's leaves are its defining feature, notable for their large, coarse teeth along the margins. These leaves are bright green and shimmer in the wind due to their flattened petioles, a characteristic shared with its relative, the Quaking Aspen. In autumn, the foliage turns a brilliant yellow, providing a striking display. The tree is also known for its ability to rapidly colonize open areas, thanks to its prolific seeding and root suckers, playing a crucial role in ecological succession.</p><p>Often found in moist, sandy, or well-drained soils, the Large-tooth Aspen is frequently used for pulp and paper production. In natural settings, it provides habitat and food for wildlife. Its quick growth and vibrant fall color make it a popular choice for reforestation projects and naturalized landscaping, although its aggressive root system can be problematic in urban or small garden settings.</p>",

    description: "<p>The Poison Sumac, Toxicodendron vernix, is a highly toxic plant native to swampy, wet areas in eastern North America. This deciduous shrub or small tree can grow up to 20 feet tall, though it is more commonly seen as a smaller shrub. It is often identified by its smooth, gray bark and the striking red stems that hold its leaves.</p><p>Poison Sumac's leaves are pinnately compound, usually with 7 to 13 leaflets per leaf. The leaflets are smooth-edged, oblong, and have a glossy texture, turning a brilliant red-orange in the fall. In early summer, it produces small greenish-white flowers, followed by white or grayish fruit that persists through winter. This tree should be avoided, as all parts of the plant contain urushiol, the same oil found in poison ivy and poison oak, which can cause severe allergic reactions upon contact with skin.</p><p>While Poison Sumac is not typically used in landscaping due to its toxic nature, it plays a role in its native wetland ecosystems, providing habitat and food for wildlife. Its striking fall foliage adds a splash of color to these wet environments, but caution is advised when near this plant.</p>",

Unlike most conifers, it sheds its needles each winter, standing out with its dazzling autumnal transformation. Tamaracks reach moderate heights of 40 to 80 feet, growing with a narrow, conical shape that becomes more open with age.</p><p>In spring, the Tamarack bursts into life with soft, light green needles, which turn a brilliant yellow-gold in the fall before dropping, leaving the tree bare in winter. Its needles are short and borne in dense clusters on older branches, giving the tree a feathery texture. Small, rounded cones emerge, initially red and maturing to brown.</p><p>The Tamarack's bark is tight and gray-brown, becoming deeply fissured over time. Adapted to cold, boggy soils, it’s often found in swamps and wet northern forests. Despite its preference for wet conditions, it is surprisingly fire-resistant. The Tamarack plays a vital role in its ecosystem and is valued for its rot-resistant wood. With its unique deciduous nature, this tree offers a striking seasonal display, especially vivid in autumn landscapes.</p>",

    description: "<p>The Yellow Buckeye, Aesculus flava, is a stately and robust deciduous tree native to the southeastern United States. It typically reaches heights of 50 to 75 feet, though it can grow taller under ideal conditions. The tree is notable for its large, palmately compound leaves, which consist of five to seven leaflets that emerge a bright green and turn a rich yellow in the fall, contributing to its autumnal display.</p><p>In the spring, the Yellow Buckeye produces showy, upright clusters of pale yellow to greenish-yellow flowers, which are a nectar source for a variety of pollinators. These flowers give way to smooth, light brown seed capsules, each containing one or two large, shiny seeds, or “buckeyes.” The tree's bark is gray-brown and becomes increasingly rough and furrowed with age.</p><p>Often found in rich, moist woods and along stream banks, the Yellow Buckeye is valued for its shade and ornamental qualities. Despite its beauty, all parts of the tree, especially the seeds, are toxic if ingested. Its grand stature and striking spring flowers make it a noteworthy addition to parks, large gardens, and naturalized areas.</p>",
